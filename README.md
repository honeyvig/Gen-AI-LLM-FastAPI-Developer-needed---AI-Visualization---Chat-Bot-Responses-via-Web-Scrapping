# Gen-AI-LLM-FastAPI-Developer-needed---AI-Visualization---Chat-Bot-Responses-via-Web-Scrapping

To achieve the task described for updating a FastAPI application deployed on Render for AI integration and web scraping, we need to break down the steps and key components needed for the backend developer. Specifically, you'll be working with:

    FastAPI to handle HTTP requests and API responses.
    Web Scraping to gather and process data from websites.
    AI Integration to process inputs and return relevant responses.

The Python code example below demonstrates how you might structure this application using FastAPI, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and OpenAI's GPT model (or another AI model) for handling the chat responses.
Steps Involved:

    Setting up FastAPI – Create endpoints for handling incoming requests.
    Web Scraping – Extract relevant data from web pages.
    AI Integration – Use an AI model to process inputs and generate responses.
    Render Deployment – Use Render's platform to deploy the app.

Python Code for Backend System

First, you need to install the required dependencies:

pip install fastapi[all] beautifulsoup4 requests openai

main.py – FastAPI Application with Web Scraping & AI Integration

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import openai
import os

# Initialize FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API key configuration (ensure to set it as an environment variable)
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Define Pydantic model for receiving inputs
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
    url: str  # URL for web scraping

# Web scraping function using BeautifulSoup
def scrape_web_page(url: str) -> str:
    """ Scrape the content from the provided URL. """
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch URL: {url}")
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
        text_content = " ".join([p.get_text() for p in soup.find_all("p")])  # Extract all paragraph texts
        return text_content
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

# AI chat response function using OpenAI GPT model
def get_ai_response(user_input: str, web_data: str) -> str:
    """ Get AI response from OpenAI API based on user query and web data. """
    try:
        # Concatenate user query with scraped data as context for the model
        prompt = f"Here is the data from a website:\n{web_data}\n\nUser query: {user_input}\nAnswer the query based on the above content."
        
        # Call OpenAI's API to get a response (GPT-3 or similar model)
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # Change to the appropriate engine if needed
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=200,  # Limit the response length
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7,  # Adjust creativity
        )

        answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        return answer
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"AI response error: {str(e)}")

# FastAPI route to handle query requests
@app.post("/query/")
async def process_query(request: QueryRequest):
    """ Endpoint to process queries using web scraping and AI. """
    # Scrape the web page based on URL
    scraped_data = scrape_web_page(request.url)
    
    # Get the AI model's response based on user query and scraped content
    ai_answer = get_ai_response(request.query, scraped_data)
    
    return {"query": request.query, "response": ai_answer}

# Root route to check if the app is running
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the AI Backend System with Web Scraping"}

Explanation of the Code:

    FastAPI Setup:
        We import FastAPI and the necessary modules.
        Define a Pydantic model QueryRequest to handle incoming POST requests, which include a query (user's question) and a url (web page URL for scraping).

    Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:
        The function scrape_web_page(url) uses the requests library to fetch the content of the webpage, and BeautifulSoup is used to extract all paragraph (<p>) text from the page.

    AI Integration with OpenAI:
        The function get_ai_response() generates an AI-powered response by calling the OpenAI API (GPT-3, or similar).
        It formats the user query along with the scraped web content and uses that as context for the AI model, allowing it to generate a more relevant and context-aware response.

    POST Endpoint for Handling Queries:
        The /query/ endpoint processes incoming requests where the user provides a query and a URL for scraping.
        The application scrapes the content from the provided URL, sends the query along with the scraped content to the AI model, and returns the AI's response.

    Root Endpoint:
        A simple GET request on the root URL / to check if the FastAPI app is running properly.

Deployment on Render:

To deploy the FastAPI app on Render:

    Create a new Render project and connect your repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

    Make sure to configure Render's environment variables for the OpenAI API key:
        OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key.

    Add the following render.yaml file for deployment configuration (if needed):

    services:
      - type: web
        name: fastapi-ai-backend
        env: python
        buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
        startCommand: "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"

    Push your code to GitHub, and Render will automatically detect and deploy the app.

    Visit your deployed FastAPI endpoint on Render, and you should be able to interact with the AI-powered backend for web scraping and query processing.

Example Usage:

    POST Request Example:
        You can send a POST request to https://<render_app_url>/query/ with a JSON body like:

{
  "query": "What are the main points discussed in this article?",
  "url": "https://example.com/article"
}

Response Example:

    The response from the API would be a JSON object like:

    {
      "query": "What are the main points discussed in this article?",
      "response": "The article discusses the importance of AI in modern industries, highlighting key sectors such as healthcare, finance, and education."
    }

Conclusion:

This Python-based FastAPI backend application allows for AI integration with web scraping and chat-based query responses. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for scraping and OpenAI GPT models for processing the queries based on the scraped data. You can deploy this on Render and expand its functionality as needed.
